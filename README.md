# PNG2ICO
Simple script that changes ".png" to ".ico". It is really helpful, because most graphic design programms can't do it easily for some reason.

<img src="PNG2ICO.png">

# Usage
1. Run PNG2ICO
2. Input path/filename of ".png" file (if you input path, don't include "/" at the end)

Results will be in the same folder as the ".png" file.

# Requirements
* Pillow==8.4.0
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
